# JSON Parser
Jackson JSON Java Parser is very popular and used in Spring framework too. Java JSON Processing API is not very user friendly and doesnâ€™t provide features for automatic transformation from Json to Java object and vice versa.

Initialise the Json file directory in the src file.
You can do iterative operations on this json file as the mapping and deserializing is already done.


Thankyou
